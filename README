Beginning with version 1.6, WSJT-X now uses an improved version of the k9an wspr
decoder that was developed in a collaboration between K9AN and K1JT. The version
used in WSJT-X has been carefully optimized for excellent weak-signal decoding
capability while maintaining a low probability of false decodes and minimizing
execution time. For the latest wsprd code, visit the WSJT-X svn repository at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt/.
